# Steam Friends Blocker

Are you tired of people harassing, bothering, and stalking you on Steam? Well, first of all, you should consider therapy LOL. But if you're in good mental health, let me introduce you to Steam Friends Blocker. It's a script that works through the console in your browser on the Steam website. Its purpose is to automatically block all the people it detects in someone else's friends list. I created it as a small personal project just to see if it could be done, and now I'm sharing it with the community.

### Uses you can give it:

- Security and privacy on Steam in case you want to keep your profile public.

- Block people who bother you or who you think might do so.

- Avoid scammers, stalkers, groomers and any other kind of weirdo on Steam.

- placebo.

### How to use it?

1. Go to the user's profile in your preferred browser.

2. Navigate to their friends list (if it's not public, the script won't work, as there's no way to bypass that).

3. Press the F12 key on your keyboard to open the browser's context menu.

4. Go to the section that says "Console".

5. Copy the JavaScript script found in the "script.js" file, which you can find in the repository.

6. Paste it there (if your browser doesn't allow it, simply type "allow pasting" in the console to enable it).

7. Follow the script's instructions.

### Important!

- You must enable pop-up windows on Steam. To do this:

1. Click the website settings button (usually is a padlock icon in the address bar) and select "Site settings" (In this example, I'm using Brave Browser, steps may vary slightly depending on your browser).

2. Find the section labeled "Pop-ups and redirects" and set it to "Allow."

3. Refresh the website.

### To Do

- Make it work in Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey as an enhanced script.
- Add functionality to block multiple users by their user ID (SteamID64 or probably adding compatibility with all kinds of SteamID's).
- Add a log system.
- Connect to external databases if required (this is in case someone needs to block people like cheaters and scammers from a database like TF2BD and SourceBans [I probably won’t do this, as it’s very ambiguous and specific]).
- Taking any suggestion or issue, I'll try to be aware of bugs or adding new features, like making it more expandable and complex.
